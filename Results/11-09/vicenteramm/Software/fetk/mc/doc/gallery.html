Here is an example of
<A HREF="index.html">MC</A>
applied to a large deformation nonlinear elasticity problem.
The red face at the left end of the (steel) bar is fixed to a wall, 
and traction forces are applied to the light blue and white patches of
the surface of the bar to give the bar a ``twist''.
This is sort of like hitting the bar with two hammers at the same time,
in not quite opposite directions.
After building a finite element approximating system using simplex-based
elements, MC solves the nonlinear algebraic system using a damped inexact 
Newton method, with some help from continuation (simple natural parameter
in the forces).
MC solves the linear systems at each Newton iteration with an
unstructured algebraic multilevel method.
