The PUNC ChangeLog
------------------

Fri Jun  2 23:11:20 PDT 2006 Michael Holst

 * PUNC gets named; separation from MALOC/MC as LA Framework         060206

The PUNC TODO List
------------------

This is the PUNC "TODO" list, basically a list of known problems that need
to be fixed, or desirable features that I (or someone else) would like to
add to PUNC.  The list is divided into sublists, according to which primary 
component of PUNC the task involves hacking into.  The column on the left
side of each sublist refers to which state the task is currently in:

  o <Open>        ==> It is not completed, and no one is working on it yet.
  - <In Progress> ==> Someone is working on it, but it is not done.
  x <Completed>   ==> The task has been completed and the code has been tested.

For the "in progress" tasks, the name of the person working on it (usually me)
will usually be listed somewhere in the description of the task.
