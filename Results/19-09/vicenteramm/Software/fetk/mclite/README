Here is what you need to do to access the online MCLite documentation:

    1. Start MATLAB (by typing "matlab")

    2. Initialize MCLite (by typing "setpath")

    3. List the MCLite help topics in MATLAB (by typing "help")

    4. Read the MCLite overview in MATLAB (by typing "help mclite")

Here is what you need to do to use MCLite with MATLAB's graphics:

    1. Edit the MCLite driver "go.m" to adjust any settings you want.

    2. Start MATLAB (by typing "matlab")

    3. Initialize MCLite (by typing "setpath")

    4. Start the MCLite driver by typing "go"

Here is what you need to do to use MCLite with Geomview graphics:

    1. Start Geomview listening to a UNIX domain socket by typing:

              geomview -Mcs 11

       You must have previously installed Geomview on your machine; it is
       available from the University of Minnesota's Geometry Center site:

              http://www.geom.umn.edu/

    2. Make sure you have the binary "mcbridge" in the "work" subdirectory;
       it can be downloaded from the same site that contains MCLite:

              http://www.fetk.org/

    3. Edit the MCLite driver "go.m" and set "socktype" to 0 (for UNIX sockets)
       (Also make sure that the socket display settings are enabled.)

    4. Start MATLAB (by typing "matlab")

    5. Initialize MCLite (by typing "setpath")

    6. Start the MCLite driver by typing "go"

Here is what you need to do to use MCLite with MCsg graphics on the same or
on a remote machine:

    1. Start MCsg listening to an INET socket (on the workstation in front
       of you) by typing:

              ./mcsg -Mci 11

       For this to work, MCsg must be in the "work" subdirectory or in some
       directory in your path.  MCsg can be downloaded from the
       same site that contains MCLite:

              http://www.fetk.org/

    2. Make sure you have the binary "mcbridge" in the "work" subdirectory
       (or some directory in your path).  MCbridge can be downloaded from the
       same site that contains MCLite:

              http://www.fetk.org/

    3. Edit the MCLite driver "go.m" and set "socktype" to 1 (for INET sockets)
       (Also make sure that the socket display settings are enabled.)

    4. Start MATLAB (by typing "matlab", possibly on a remote machine)

    5. Initialize MCLite (by typing "setpath")

    6. Start the MCLite driver by typing "go"
