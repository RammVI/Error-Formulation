The SG ChangeLog

 * See the MC ChangeLog for early SG development history. SG
   was originally completely integrated with MC as a single binary.
   The split into two separate binaries called "mcsh" for pure number
   crunching and "sg" for OpenGL graphics, communicating together
   via pipes, UNIX domain sockets, and INET sockets, occured in Fall
   1997 and Spring 1998.

The SG TODO List
----------------

This is the SG "TODO" list, basically a list of known problems that need
to be fixed, or desirable features that I (or someone else) would like to
add to SG.  The list is divided into sublists, according to which primary 
component of SG the task involves hacking into.  The column on the left side
of each sublist refers to which state the task is currently in:

  o <Open>        ==> It is not completed, and no one is working on it yet.
  - <In Progress> ==> Someone is working on it, but it is not done.
  x <Completed>   ==> The task has been completed and the code has been tested.

For the "in progress" tasks, the name of the person working on it (usually me)
will usually be listed somewhere in the description of the task.
