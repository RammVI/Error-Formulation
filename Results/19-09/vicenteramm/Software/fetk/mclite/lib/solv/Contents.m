% Finite element assembly and solver library
%
% This library implements nonlinear and linear finite element assembly and
% nonlinear and linear algebraic solvers.
%
% The available routines are as follows:
%
%      ASSEM         nonlinear residual and tangent system assembly
%      LSOLVE        solve the discrete system with linear solver
%      NSOLVE        solve the discrete system with newton's method
